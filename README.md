This is a web layout of the HOME page designed for a "Charity" organization.

I have used Photoshop; HTML4 / HTML5; CSS2 / CSS3; JavaScript & jQuery. 

Plus, I used Canva for designing the business logo. 

However, please do note that the images & text matter used in various sections of the website are dummy text/images which I have used while designing this layout. 

And the original text & logo has been updated while delivering the final product to my client.
