        	<h1>SAVE THE CHILDREN</h1>
            <p>Around the world, too many children still start life at a disadvantage simply because of who they are and where they are from.</p>
            <p>We are gravely concerned for children around the world caught in the middle of armed conflicts and wars in countries such as Sudan and Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The combined impact of conflict, climate change, COVID-19, and the rising costs of food and fuel mean that 783 million people around the world don’t know where their next meal is coming from.</p>
            <p>Children's rights to survival, protection and education are under immediate threat. We can do something about it. Help us protect children to ensure they not only survive but thrive.</p>
			<p>We work in several policy areas to support older people in Europe.</p>
			<ul class="disc_list">
            	<li>We fight for older people and their rights to be embedded in the development cooperation policies.</li>
                <li>We aim to increase the quality and effectiveness of EU humanitarian aid policy by ensuring that the specific needs of older people are fully addressed in humanitarian responses.</li>
                <li>We work to influence the EU and its Member States’ contributions to the UN Open-ended Working Group on Ageing process and support the move towards a new UN convention on the rights of older people.</li>

            <h1>Democracy is not a question of money</h1>
            <p>One finding is particularly worrying. The distribution report published by the Hans Böckler Foundation's Institute of Economic and Social Research (WSI) at the beginning of November shows that people living in poverty have particularly low levels of trust in democratic institutions, in parliament, political parties and politicians. This dissatisfaction has a substantive core. People living in poverty have often experienced that their interests count for less and that others look down on them. They are underrepresented in parliaments and their interests are less heard.</p>
<p>Dissatisfaction with the distribution of income and wealth, on the other hand, is not a problem limited to people with low incomes. In a study conducted by the Bertelsmann Stiftung in 2022, 79% of respondents said wealth and income were not fairly distributed in Germany. There was broad support for more redistributive measures by the state. At the same time, there was little willingness to raise taxes to provide financial support for people living in poverty. Only 37 percent agreed with this.</p>
<p>Different ideas of justice seem to be in conflict here. Should people receive assistance according to their needs? Or should income and assets always be in proportion to individual performance? And what would that mean in terms of inheritance, for example? Inheritance taxes are unpopular, even though the vast majority of people in Germany never inherit. Only 30 percent of the population receives a gift or inheritance in the course of their lives, while 40 percent of all households have no assets. A more equitable distribution may be widely desired in the abstract, but in reality, the willingness of individuals to participate financially is low. There is also a lack of knowledge about how such participation might take shape. The question of the right measures therefore remains an ongoing controversy. How can this contradiction be resolved and the drifting apart of social worlds be avoided?</p>

            <h1>Myths on Migration</h1>
            <p>Irregular migration is really exaggerated because it gets so much public and media attention. People might almost think that more people are entering Europe irregularly than regularly. It's exactly the opposite. Every year, more than 2 million people  arrive in Europe legally on all kinds of permits – basically, work visas or student visas – compared to at most a few 100,000 people in total arriving irregularly over land and sea. There's a big difference there. In general, most people in the world don't migrate at all. They stay quite close to where they were born. If people migrate, most do so within their own countries. If they do migrate further away, most do so in a legal manner. And then there's a small minority that migrates irregularly. But if you follow the media, you might almost think that's exactly the other way around. I think it's a very unhelpful portrayal of migration that feeds into a false narrative that things are completely out of control and numbers are unmanageable. Even now, when the numbers of people arriving in Europe along irregular land and sea routes are going up again,  for a rich continent of 550 million people this is perfectly manageable if we make the right investments and don’t panic over relatively small numbers.</p>
